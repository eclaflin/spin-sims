# Overview

- Roulette table is arranged in 2 sections: inside and outside
  - Inside area contains the 36 numbered squares, each either red or black
  - Outside area contains boxes that cover a broader range of numbers (e.g. odd or even)
  - At the top of the table, there are zero or double-zero boxes

- Each square of the board (including zero/double-zero) are referred to as "pockets"
  - So in the American roulette board (i.e. with a double-zero), there are 38 pockets (36 numbered plus two "zero" pockets)
- The inside board can be further divided to represent combinations of pockets that correspond to different bet types, according to:

| Grouping | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Split    | 2 numbers, either from adjacent rows or adjacent columns |
| Street   | 3 numbers, corresponding to a complete row of the table  |
| Corner   | 4 numbers, as formed by a 2x2 matrix of pockets          |
| Line     | 6 numbers, as formed by combining 2 adjacent streets     |
| Top Line | 5 numbers, as formed by combining the first two rows (i.e. the "zero" row and adjacent) |
